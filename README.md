# Genetic Algorithm
A genetic algorithm that finds the solution of correct column ordering for a "shredded" text file.
The solution is the final permutation of the genome that shows the correct order of columns to the original readable text.

#### Goal 
`Build a genetic algorithm that finds the fittest genome to solve the shredded documents original text.`

### Parameters
```java
//params to adjust the GA 
int populationSize = 0;
int maxGenerations = 0;
float crossOverRate = 0f;
float mutationRate = 0f;
float elitePer = 0f;
float tournamentSizePer = 0f;
long seed = 0;
```
### Experimental Setup
<strong>To reproduce similar results ðŸ‘‡</strong>
<li>The population will be set to <strong>500</strong>. 
<li>The max generations are set to <strong>30</strong>.
<li>The experiment will be testing <strong>shredded document 3</strong>. 
<li>The fitness of the correct solution for document 3 is 743.

### Experimental Results
y-axis is the fitness of the fittest genome in the pool.

Hey, look at me
. It's your fau
lt, it's everyo
ne's fault, who
 cares. Are you
 up for this? A
re you? Look, I
 just need to k
now, cause the 
city is flying.
 Okay, look, th
e city is flyin
g, we're fighti
ng an army of r
obots, and I ha
ve a bow and ar
row. None of th
is makes sense.
 But I'm going 
back out there 
because it's my
 job. Okay? And
 I can't do my 
job and babysit
. It doesn't ma
tter what you d
id, or what you
 were. If you g
o out there, yo
u fight, and yo
u fight to kill
. Stay in here,
 you're good, I
'll send your b
rother to come 
find you, but i
f you step out 
that door, you 
are an Avenger.
 Alright, good 
chat. Yeah, the
 city is flying
.
